description: Use when extending TopoGlyph to a new domain or problem.

1. Read all of `~/.topoglyph/modules/topoglyph-v0.md` - the file exceeds the single-read token cap, so issue **two** Read calls in sequence: one with `offset: 1, limit: 900` and one with `offset: 901, limit: 900`.

2. Extend TopoGlyph to the new domain or problem.
